# DH140FinalProject

I decided to focus on the topic of discrimination on the basis of sex, specifically in the professional sector. As a woman who is involved in the Computer Science field, I am extremely aware of the discrepancies between how my male peers (in academia or industry) are treated compared to my female peers and myself. I have heard many so-called horror stories from other women in my life about their professional experiences being hampered by their gendered. I wondered if this was a general trend, or only in the CS field. I decided to use this project as a way for me to explore not only the presence of this discrimination, but also the possible causes of these discrepancies in the way women are treated at work.

I am aiming to answer the following question: **What factors play a role in the differences in female and male employment?**
